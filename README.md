# Customer Segmentation for International Wholesale Customers-using Machine Learning
This project focuses on creating customer segments for an online UK-based retailer specializing in all-occasion gifts. The retailer has a significant number of international customers, primarily wholesalers, and aims to group them based on their purchase patterns to improve marketing strategies and provide tailored services.

Currently, the retailer groups customers by country, which is inefficient due to the large number of countries, small customer bases in some regions, and the lack of consideration for individual purchase behaviors. This project aims to address these issues by building a data-driven clustering model to create meaningful customer segments.

This project is based on Unsupervised Learning.

Input dataset is present in Files folder.

I jupyter Notebbook their is actual coding right from Data Analysis to clustering using K-mean.
